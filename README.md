Help From Sockstress, ImFoxxyyy & Cain532
Socktress originally gave a example for how a weapon struct worked in the undead weapons online, so he majorly helped get that made, and that's why he is mentioned here. Cain and Foxxyyy have helped more than they know with native documentation, examples, and answering any questions i've had. Which is why they get a honerable mention here!
